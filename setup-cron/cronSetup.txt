Setting up a cron job on the terminal

Step 1: Create a shell script file with the commands you want to execute repeatedly for example.
	File: test.sh
	inside test.sh: df -h #This command will check the space on you machine

Step 2: Open up the terminal and type the following
env EDITOR=nano crontab -e

The above command will open up a file for the crontab where you can add cronjobs

Step 3: At the bottom of the crontab type the timer and the sh command plus the location of the file

timer        command   location of file
*/10 * * * * sh /home/shaeen/test.sh

Check the list of cron jobs you have type the following in the terminal
crontab -l
